\title{Install Hugo}
\usage{
install_hugo(version = "latest", use_brew = Sys.which("brew") != "",
  force = FALSE)

update_hugo()
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{The Hugo version number, e.g., \code{0.26}; the special value
\code{latest} means the latest version (fetched from Github releases).}

\item{use_brew}{Whether to use Homebrew (\url{https://brew.sh}) on macOS to
install Hugo (recommended if you have already installed Homebrew). Note
Homebrew will be automatically installed if it has not been installed when
\code{use_brew = TRUE}.}

\item{force}{Whether to install Hugo even if it has already been installed.
This may be useful when upgrading Hugo (if you use Homebrew, run the
command \command{brew update && brew upgrade} instead).}
}
\description{
Download the appropriate Hugo executable for your platform from Github and
try to copy it to a system directory so \pkg{blogdown} can run the
\command{hugo} command to build a site. \code{update_hugo()} is a wrapper of
\code{install_hugo(force = TRUE)}.
}
\details{
This function tries to install Hugo to \code{Sys.getenv('APPDATA')} on
Windows, \file{~/Library/Application Support} on macOS, and \file{~/bin/} on
other platforms (such as Linux). If these directories are not writable, the
package directory \file{Hugo} of \pkg{blogdown} will be used. If it still
fails, you have to install Hugo by yourself and make sure it can be found via
the environment variable \code{PATH}.

This is just a helper function and may fail to choose the correct Hugo
executable for your operating system, especially if you are not on Windows or
Mac or a major Linux distribution. When in doubt, read the Hugo documentation
and install it by yourself: \url{https://gohugo.io}.
